Later works, including the ''[[Aethiopis]]'' (7th century BC) and a work named ''[[Posthomerica]]'', composed by [[Quintus of Smyrna]] in the fourth century CE, relate further events from the [[Trojan War]]. When [[Penthesilea]], queen of the [[Amazons]] and daughter of [[Ares]], arrives in Troy, Priam hopes that she will defeat Achilles. After his temporary truce with Priam, Achilles fights and kills the warrior queen, only to grieve over her death later.<ref>[[Propertius]], 3.11.15; [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] 1.</ref> Initially taken aback, he did not fight as intensely as usual. Once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life, he refocused and killed her.

Following the death of Patroclus, Nestor's son [[Antilochus]] becomes Achilles' closest companion. When [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]], son of the Dawn Goddess [[Eos]] and king of [[Ethiopia (mythology)|Ethiopia]], slays Antilochus, Achilles once more obtains revenge on the battlefield, killing Memnon. Consequently, Eos will not let the sun rise until Zeus persuades her. The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus, except that Memnon (unlike Hector) was also the son of a goddess.

Many Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the ''Iliad''{{'}}s description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles' reaction to it. The episode then formed the basis of the [[Epic Cycle|cyclic epic]] ''[[Aethiopis]]'', which was composed after the ''Iliad'', possibly in the 7th century BC. The ''Aethiopis'' is now lost, except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors.

===Achilles and Patroclus===

The exact nature of Achilles' relationship with Patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times. In the ''Iliad'', it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship. Homer does not suggest that Achilles and his close friend Patroclus had sexual relations.<ref name="Fox 2011">{{cite book |title= The Tribal Imagination: Civilization and the Savage Mind |author= Robin Fox |year= 2011 |publisher= Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674060944 |quote= There is certainly no evidence in the text of the Iliad that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers.|page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=YCxy_4Bt1F0C&pg=PA223 223]}}</ref><ref name="Martin 2012">{{cite book |title= Alexander the Great: The Story of an Ancient Life|last= Martin |first= Thomas R |year= 2012 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 978-0521148443 |quote= The ancient sources do not report, however, what modern scholars have asserted: that Alexander and his very close friend Hephaestion were lovers. Achilles and his equally close friend Patroclus provided the legendary model for this friendship, but Homer in the ''Iliad'' never suggested that they had sex with each other. (That came from later authors.).|page=100}}</ref> Although there is no direct evidence in the text of the ''Iliad'' that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers, this theory was expressed by some later authors. Commentators from [[classical antiquity]] to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures. In 5th-century BC Athens, the intense bond was often viewed in light of the [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|Greek custom of ''paiderasteia'']], which is the relationship between an older male and a younger one, usually a teenager. In Patroclus and Achilles' case, Achilles would have been the younger as Patroclus is usually seen as his elder. In Plato's ''Symposium'', the participants in a dialogue about love assume that Achilles and Patroclus were a couple; Phaedrus argues that Achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and Patroclus was the lover.<ref>[[Plato]], ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Sym.+180a 180a]; the beauty of Achilles was a topic already broached at ''Iliad'' 2.673–674.</ref> However, ancient Greek had no words to distinguish [[heterosexual]] and [[homosexual]],<ref>[[Kenneth Dover]], ''Greek Homosexuality'' (Harvard University Press, 1978, 1989), p. 1 ''et passim''.</ref> and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women. Many pairs of men throughout history have been compared to Achilles and Patroclus to imply a homosexual relationship.{{cn|date=January 2025}}

===<span class="anchor" id="Fatalwound"></span> Death ===
[[File:Closeup of Achilles thniskon in Corfu Achilleion autocorrected.JPG|thumb|left|''Dying Achilles'' (Achilleas thniskon) in the gardens of the Achilleion]]

The death of Achilles, even if considered solely as it occurred in the oldest sources, is a complex one, with many different versions.<ref>Abrantes 2016: c. 4.3.1</ref> Starting with the oldest account, In book 22 of the ''Iliad'', [[Hector]] predicts with his last dying breath that [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] and [[Apollo]] will slay him at the Scaean Gates leading to Troy (with an arrow to the heel according to Statius). In book 23, the sad spirit of dead Patroclus visits Achilles just as he drifts off into slumber, requesting that his bones be placed with those of Achilles in his golden vase, a gift of his mother.

[[File:Aias body Akhilleus Staatliche Antikensammlungen 1884.jpg|thumb|right|Ajax carries off the body of Achilles, [[Attica|Attic]] black-figure [[lekythos]] from Sicily, {{Circa|510 BC}} ([[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]], Munich).]]
In book 11 of the ''[[Odyssey]]'', Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades. One of these is Achilles, who when greeted as "blessed in life, blessed in death", responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead. But Achilles then asks Odysseus of his son's exploits in the Trojan war, and Odysseus tells him of Neoptolemus' actions.<ref>''Odyssey'' 11.467–564.</ref>

Book 24 of ''Odyssey'' gives dead King Agamemnon's ghostly account of Achilles' death: the bleached bones from Achilles' funeral [[pyre]] had been mixed with those of [[Patroclus]] and put into his mother's golden vase. Also, the bones of [[Antilochus of Pylos|Antilochus]], who had become closer to Achilles than any other following Patroclus' death, were separately enclosed. The customary funeral games of a hero were performed, and a massive tomb or [[mound]] was built on the [[Hellespont]] for approaching seagoers to celebrate.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Odyssey of Homer| author= Richmond Lattimore| publisher = Harper Perennial| year = 2007| isbn = 978-0-06-124418-6| location = New York| page = 347}}</ref>

Achilles was represented in the ''Aethiopis'' as living after his death in the island of [[Leuke]] at the mouth of the river [[Danube]]. Another version of Achilles' death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the Trojan princesses, [[Polyxena]]. Achilles asks Priam for Polyxena's hand in marriage. Priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world's greatest warrior. But while Priam is overseeing the private marriage of Polyxena and Achilles, Paris, who would have to give up Helen if Achilles married his sister, hides in the bushes and shoots Achilles with a divine arrow, killing him. According to some accounts, he had married [[Medea]] in life, so that after both their deaths they were united in the [[Elysium|Elysian Fields]] of [[Hades]]—as Hera promised Thetis in [[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius]]' ''[[Argonautica]]'' (3rd century BC).

===Fate of Achilles' armour===
[[File:Odysseus Ajax Louvre F340.jpg|thumb|left|Oinochoe, {{circa|520}} BC, [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] and [[Odysseus]] fighting over the armour of Achilles]]
Achilles' armour was the object of a feud between [[Odysseus]] and [[Ajax the Great|Telamonian Ajax]] (Ajax the greater). They competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners, who, after considering both men's presentations, decided Odysseus was more deserving of the armour. Furious, Ajax cursed Odysseus, which earned him the ire of Athena, who temporarily made Ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep, thinking them his comrades. After a while, when Athena lifted his madness and Ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep, he was so ashamed that he committed suicide. Odysseus eventually gave the armour to [[Neoptolemus]], the son of Achilles. When Odysseus encounters the shade of Ajax much later in the House of Hades (''Odyssey'' 11.543–566), Ajax is still so angry about the outcome of the competition that he refuses to speak to Odysseus.

The armour they fought for was made by [[Hephaestus]] and thus much stronger and more beautiful than any armour a mortal could craft. Thetis had the gear made for Achilles because his first set was worn by [[Patroclus]] when he went to battle and taken by [[Hector]] when he killed Patroclus. The [[Shield of Achilles]] was also made by the fire god. His legendary spear was given to him by his mentor [[Chiron]] before he participated in the [[Trojan War]]. It was called the Pelian Spear, which allegedly no other man could wield.

A relic claimed to be Achilles' bronze-headed spear was preserved for centuries in the temple of Athena on the acropolis of [[Phaselis]], Lycia, a port on the Pamphylian Gulf. The city was visited in 333 BC by [[Alexander the Great]], who envisioned himself as the new Achilles and carried the ''Iliad'' with him, but his court biographers do not mention the spear; however, it was shown in the time of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] in the 2nd century CE.<ref>"Alexander came to rest at Phaselis, a coastal city which was later renowned for the possession of Achilles' original spear."

===Achilles, Ajax and a game of ''petteia''===
Numerous paintings on pottery have suggested a tale not mentioned in the literary traditions. At some point in the war, Achilles and [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] were playing a [[board game]] (''petteia'').<ref>[http://www.personal.psu.edu/wxk116/roma/petteia.html "Petteia".] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209122834/http://www.personal.psu.edu/wxk116/roma/petteia.html |date=9 December 2006 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/Archives/Austin/index.html "Greek Board Games".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408090534/http://www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/Archives/Austin/index.html |date=8 April 2009 }}</ref> They were absorbed in the game and oblivious to the surrounding battle.<ref>[http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/w/x/wxk116/roma/latruncu.html "Latrunculi".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060915044905/http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/w/x/wxk116/roma/latruncu.html |date=15 September 2006 }}</ref> The Trojans attacked and reached the heroes, who were saved only by an intervention of Athena.<ref>[[Ioannis Kakridis]] (1988).

The spread and intensity of the hero's veneration among the [[Greeks in pre-Roman Crimea|Greeks]] that had [[Second Greek colonisation|settled]] on the northern coast of the [[Pontus Euxinus]], today's [[Black Sea]], appears to have been remarkable. An archaic cult is attested for the [[Miletus|Milesian]] colony of [[Olbia (Pontic)|Olbia]] as well as for an island in the middle of the Black Sea, today identified with [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|Snake Island]] ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] Зміїний, ''Zmiinyi'', near [[Kiliia]], Ukraine). Early dedicatory inscriptions from the [[Greek colonies]] on the Black Sea ([[graffiti]] and inscribed clay disks, these possibly being [[votive offering]]s, from Olbia, the area of [[Berezan Island]] and the [[Tauric Chersonese]]<ref>{{cite journal|author=Hildebrecht Hommel|title=Der Gott Achilleus|journal=Sitzungsberichte der Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften|issue=1|year=1980|pages=38–44}}</ref>) attest the existence of a [[heroic cult]] of Achilles<ref>{{cite journal|author=J. T. Hooker|title=The cults of Achilleus|journal=Rheinisches Museum für Philologie|volume=131|issue=3|date=1988|pages=1–7}}</ref> from the sixth century BC onwards. The cult was still thriving in the third century CE, when dedicatory [[stelae]] from Olbia refer to an ''Achilles Pontárchēs'' (Ποντάρχης, roughly 'lord of the sea', or 'lord of the [[Pontus Euxinus]]'), who was invoked as a protector of the city of Olbia, venerated on par with [[Olympian gods]] such as the local [[Apollo]] Prostates, [[Hermes]] Agoraeus,<ref name=Hedreen/> or [[Poseidon]].<ref>Quintus Smyrnaeus, 3.770–779.</ref>

[[Pliny the Elder]] (23–79 AD) in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' mentions a "port of the Achæi" and an "island of Achilles", famous for the tomb of that "man" ({{lang|la|portus Achaeorum, insula Achillis, tumulo eius viri clara}}), situated somewhat nearby Olbia and the [[Dnieper-Bug Estuary]]; furthermore, at 125&nbsp;[[Roman mile]]s from this island, he places a peninsula "which stretches forth in the shape of a sword" obliquely, called ''Dromos Achilleos'' (Ἀχιλλέως δρόμος, ''Achilléōs drómos'', '[[Racecourse of Achilles|the Race-course of Achilles]]')<ref>Pliny, ''Naturalis Historia'' 4.12.83 ([https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D26#note-link10 chapter 4.26]).</ref> and considered the place of the hero's exercise or of games instituted by him.<ref name=Hedreen/> This last feature of Pliny's account is considered to be the iconic [[Spit (landform)|spit]], called today ''Tendra'' (or ''Kosa Tendra'' and ''Kosa Djarilgatch''), situated between the mouth of the [[Dnieper]] and [[Karkinit Bay]], but which is hardly 125&nbsp;[[Roman mile]]s ({{circa|185}}&nbsp;km) away from the [[Dnieper-Bug estuary]], as Pliny states (to the "Race-course" he gives a length of 80&nbsp;miles, {{circa|120}}&nbsp;km, whereas the spit measures {{circa|70}}&nbsp;km today).

In the following chapter of his book, Pliny refers to the same island as ''Achillea'' and introduces two further names for it: ''Leuce'' or ''Macaron'' (from Greek [νῆσος] μακαρῶν, 'island of the blest'). The "present day" measures, he gives at this point, seem to account for an identification of ''Achillea'' or ''Leuce'' with today's [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|Snake Island]].<ref>Pliny, ''Naturalis Historia'' 4.13.93 ([https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D27 chapter 4.27]): "Researches which have been made at the present day place this island at a distance of 140 miles from the Borysthenes, of 120 from [[Tyras]], and of fifty from the island of [[Peuce Island|Peuce]]. It is about ten miles in circumference." Although afterwards he speaks again of "the remaining islands in the Gulf of [[Kerkinitis|Carcinites]]" which are "Cephalonesos, Rhosphodusa [or Spodusa], and Macra".</ref> Pliny's contemporary [[Pomponius Mela]] ({{circa|43}} AD) tells that Achilles was buried on an island named ''Achillea'', situated between the [[Borysthenes]] and the [[Danube|Ister]], adding to the geographical confusion.<ref>Pomponius Mela, ''De situ orbis'' 2.7.</ref> Ruins of a square temple, measuring 30 meters to a side, possibly that dedicated to Achilles, were discovered by Captain {{ill|Nikolay Kritsky|ru|Критский, Николай Дмитриевич}} in 1823 on [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|Snake Island]]. A second exploration in 1840 showed that the construction of a lighthouse had destroyed all traces of this temple. A fifth century BC [[Black-glazed Ware|black-glazed]] [[lekythos]] inscription, found on the island in 1840, reads: "Glaukos, son of Poseidon, dedicated me to Achilles, lord of Leuke." In another inscription from the fifth or fourth century BC, a statue is dedicated to Achilles, lord of Leuke, by a citizen of Olbia, while in a further dedication, the city of Olbia confirms its continuous maintenance of the island's cult, again suggesting its quality as a place of a supra-regional hero veneration.<ref name=Hedreen/>

The heroic cult dedicated to Achilles on ''Leuce'' seems to go back to an account from the lost epic ''[[Aethiopis]]'' according to which, after his untimely death, Thetis had snatched her son from the funeral pyre and removed him to a mythical {{lang|el|Λεύκη Νῆσος}} (''Leúkē Nêsos'', 'White Island').<ref>[[Proclus]], ''Chrestomathia'' 2.</ref> Already in the fifth century BC, [[Pindar]] had mentioned a cult of Achilles on a "bright island" (φαεννά νᾶσος, ''phaenná nâsos'') of the Black Sea,<ref>Pindar, ''Nemea'' 4.49ff.; Arrian, ''[[Periplus of the Euxine Sea]]'' 21.</ref> while in another of his works, Pindar would retell the story of the immortalized Achilles living on a geographically indefinite [[Island of the Blest]] together with other heroes such as his father [[Peleus]] and [[Cadmus]].<ref>Pindar, ''Olympia'' 2.78ff.</ref> Well known is the connection of these mythological [[Fortunate Isles]] (μακαρῶν νῆσοι, ''makárôn nêsoi'') or the Homeric [[Elysium]] with the stream [[Oceanus]] which according to Greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world, which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the Euxine with it.<ref name=Hedreen/> Guy Hedreen has found further evidence for this connection of Achilles with the northern margin of the inhabited world in a poem by [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]], speaking of "Achilles lord of Scythia"<ref>D. Page, ''Lyrica Graeca Selecta'', Oxford 1968, p. 89, no. 166.</ref> and the opposition of North and South, as evoked by Achilles' fight against the [[Aethiopia]]n prince [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]], who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother [[Eos]] after his death.

The ''[[Periplus Ponti Euxini|Periplus of the Euxine Sea]]'' ({{circa|130}} AD) gives the following details:

{{blockquote|It is said that the goddess Thetis raised this island from the sea, for her son Achilles, who dwells there. Here is his temple and his statue, an archaic work. This island is not inhabited, and goats graze on it, not many, which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships, sacrifice to Achilles. In this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts, craters, rings and precious stones, offered to Achilles in gratitude. One can still read inscriptions in Greek and Latin, in which Achilles is praised and celebrated. Some of these are worded in Patroclus' honour, because those who wish to be favored by Achilles, honour Patroclus at the same time. There are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds, which look after Achilles' temple. Every morning they fly out to sea, wet their wings with water, and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it. And after they finish the sprinkling, they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings. Other people say still more, that some of the men who reach this island, come here intentionally. They bring animals in their ships, destined to be sacrificed. Some of these animals they slaughter, others they set free on the island, in Achilles' honour. But there are others, who are forced to come to this island by sea storms. As they have no sacrificial animals, but wish to get them from the god of the island himself, they consult Achilles' oracle. They ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island, and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair. But in case the oracle denies them permission, because there is an oracle here, they add something to the price offered, and if the oracle refuses again, they add something more, until at last, the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient. And then the victim doesn't run away any more, but waits willingly to be caught. So, there is a great quantity of silver there, consecrated to the hero, as price for the sacrificial victims. To some of the people who come to this island, Achilles appears in dreams, to others he would appear even during their navigation, if they were not too far away, and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships.<ref name="Densuşianu"/>}}

The Greek geographer [[Dionysius Periegetes]], who probably lived during the first century CE, wrote that the island was called ''Leuce'' "because the wild animals which live there are white. It is said that there, in Leuce island, reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes, and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island; this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues, because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honour."<ref>Dionysius Periegetes, ''Orbis descriptio'' 5.541, quoted in Densuşianu 1913.</ref> Similarly, others relate the island's name to its white cliffs, snakes or birds dwelling there.<ref name=Hedreen/><ref>Arrian, ''[[Periplus of the Euxine Sea]]'' 21; Scholion to Pindar, ''Nemea'' 4.79.</ref> [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] has been told that the island is "covered with forests and full of animals, some wild, some tame. In this island there is also Achilles' temple and his statue."<ref>Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 3.19.11.</ref> Leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing. Pausanias reports that the [[Delphi]]c [[Pythia]] sent a lord of [[Crotone|Croton]] to be cured of a chest wound.<ref>Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 3.19.13.</ref> [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] attributes the healing to waters (''aquae'') on the island.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' 22.8.</ref>

[[Strabo]] mentioned that the cape of the Racecourse of Achilles was sacred to Achilles and although it was treeless, was called Alsos (ἄλσος).<ref>[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-grc1:7.3.19 Strabo, Geography, 7.3.19]</ref> ''Alsos'' in Greek means '[[Grove (nature)|grove]]'.

A number of important commercial port cities of the Greek waters were dedicated to Achilles. [[Herodotus]], [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Strabo]] reported on the existence of a town ''Achílleion'' (Ἀχίλλειον), built by settlers from [[Mytilene]] in the sixth century BC, close to the hero's presumed burial mound in the [[Troad]].<ref name=Troad/> Later attestations point to an ''Achílleion'' in [[Messenia]] (according to [[Stephanus Byzantinus]]) and an ''Achílleios'' (Ἀχίλλειος) in [[Laconia]].<ref>Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 3.25.4.</ref> [[Nicolae Densuşianu]] recognized a connection to Achilles in the names of [[Aquileia]] and of the northern arm of the Danube delta, called [[Chilia Veche|Chilia]] (presumably from an older ''Achileii''), although his conclusion, that Leuce had sovereign rights over the Black Sea, evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law.<ref name="Densuşianu">Nicolae Densuşianu: ''Dacia preistorică''. Bucharest: Carol Göbl, 1913.</ref>

The kings of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son, [[Neoptolemus]]. [[Alexander the Great]], son of the Epirote princess [[Olympias]], could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor. He is said to have visited the tomb of Achilles at [[Achilleion (Troad)#Tomb of Achilles|Achilleion]] while passing Troy.<ref>[[Arrian]], ''[[Anabasis Alexandri]]'' 1.12.1, [[Cicero]], ''Pro Archia Poeta'' 24.</ref> In AD 216 the Roman Emperor [[Caracalla]], while on his way to war against [[Parthia]], emulated Alexander by holding games around Achilles' tumulus.<ref>[[Dio Cassius]] 78.16.7.</ref>

{{Main|Achilleis (trilogy)}}
The [[tragedy|Greek tragedian]] [[Aeschylus]] wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles, given the title ''Achilleis'' by modern scholars. The tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the Trojan War, including his defeat of [[Hector]] and eventual death when an arrow shot by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] and guided by [[Apollo]] punctures his heel. Extant fragments of the ''Achilleis'' and other Aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play. The first part of the ''Achilleis'' trilogy, ''The Myrmidons'', focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus, who represent the Achaean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Agamemnon; only a few lines survive today.<ref>Pantelis Michelakis, ''Achilles in Greek Tragedy'', 2002, p. 22</ref> In Plato's ''Symposium'', Phaedrus points out that Aeschylus portrayed Achilles as the lover and Patroclus as the beloved; Phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because Achilles, being the younger and more beautiful of the two, was the beloved, who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to avenge him.<ref>Plato, ''Symposium'', translated Benjamin Jowett, Dover Thrift Editions, page 8</ref>

The tragedian [[Sophocles]] also wrote ''The Lovers of Achilles'', a play with Achilles as the main character. Only a few fragments survive.<ref>S. Radt. ''Tragicorum Graecorum fragmenta'', vol. 4, (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1977) frr. 149–157a.</ref>

Towards the end of the 5th century BC, a more negative view of Achilles emerges in Greek drama; [[Euripides]] refers to Achilles in a bitter or ironic tone in ''[[Hecuba (play)|Hecuba]]'', ''[[Electra (Euripides)|Electra]]'', and ''[[Iphigenia in Aulis]]''.<ref name="Latacz 2010">Latacz 2010</ref>

Other contemporary tragedians, such as [[Astydamas]], wrote works on Achilles that are completely lost today.

===In Greek philosophy===

====Zeno====
The philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]] centred one of [[Zeno's paradoxes|his paradoxes]] on an imaginary footrace between "[[Epithets in Homer#Individuals|swift-footed]]" [[Achilles and the tortoise|Achilles and a tortoise]], by which he attempted to show that Achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start, and therefore that motion and change were impossible. As a student of the monist Parmenides and a member of the Eleatic school, Zeno believed time and motion to be illusions.

====Plato====
In ''[[Hippias Minor]]'', a [[Socratic dialogue]] attributed to [[Plato]], an arrogant man named Hippias argues with [[Socrates]]. The two get into a discussion about lying. They decide that a person who is intentionally false must be "better" than a person who is unintentionally false, on the basis that someone who lies intentionally must understand the subject about which they are lying.<ref name="hm">{{cite web |last1=Jowett |first1=Benjamin |author2=Plato |title=Lesser Hippias |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1673/1673-h/1673-h.htm |publisher=Project Gutenberg |date=January 15, 2013}}</ref> Socrates uses various analogies, discussing athletics and the sciences to prove his point. The two also reference Homer extensively. Socrates and Hippias agree that [[Odysseus]], who concocted a number of lies throughout the ''Odyssey'' and other stories in the Trojan War Cycle, was false intentionally. Achilles, like Odysseus, told numerous falsehoods. Hippias believes that Achilles was a generally honest man, while Socrates believes that Achilles lied for his own benefit. The two argue over whether it is better to lie on purpose or by accident. Socrates eventually abandons Homeric arguments and makes sports analogies to drive home the point: someone who does wrong on purpose is a better person than someone who does wrong unintentionally.

===In Roman and medieval literature===
The Romans, who traditionally traced their lineage to Troy, took a highly negative view of Achilles.<ref name="Latacz 2010"/> [[Virgil]] refers to Achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of men,<ref>''Aeneid'' 2.28, 1.30, 3.87.</ref> while [[Horace]] portrays Achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children.<ref>''Odes'' 4.6.17–20.</ref> Other writers, such as [[Catullus]], [[Propertius]], and [[Ovid]], represent a second strand of disparagement, with an emphasis on Achilles' erotic career. This strand continues in Latin accounts of the Trojan War by writers such as [[Dictys Cretensis]] and [[Dares Phrygius]] and in [[Benoît de Sainte-Maure]]'s {{Lang|fr|[[Roman de Troie]]}} and [[Guido delle Colonne]]'s ''[[Historia destructionis Troiae]]'', which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the [[Matter of Troy]] until the 17th century.

Achilles was described by the Byzantine chronicler [[Leo the Deacon]], not as [[Hellenes|Hellene]], but as [[Scythians|Scythian]], while according to the Byzantine author [[John Malalas]], his army was made up of a tribe previously known as Myrmidons and later as [[Bulgars]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ekonomou|first1=Andrew|title=Byzantine Rome and the Greek Popes|date=2007|publisher=Lexington Books|location=UK|page=123|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zomZk6DbFTIC&q=john+malalas+myrmidons+achilles&pg=PA123|access-date=14 September 2015|isbn=9780739119778}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Jeffreys|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Croke|first2=Brian|title=Studies in John Malalas|publisher=Australian Association for Byzantine Studies, Department of Modern Greek, University of Sydney |location=Sydney|page=206|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p55mAAAAMAAJ&q=john+malalas+myrmidons+achilles|access-date=14 September 2015|isbn=9780959362657|year=1990}}</ref>

==Namesakes==
* The name of Achilles has been used for at least nine [[Royal Navy]] warships since 1744—both as {{HMS|Achilles}} and with the French spelling {{HMS|Achille}}. A 60-gun ship of that name served at the Battle of Belleisle in 1761 while a 74-gun ship served at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]]. Other battle honours include Walcheren 1809. An armored cruiser of that name served in the Royal Navy during the First World War.
* {{HMNZS|Achilles|70|6}} was a {{sclass|Leander|cruiser|1||1931}} which served with the [[Royal New Zealand Navy]] in World War II. It became famous for its part in the [[Battle of the River Plate]], alongside {{HMS|Ajax|22|6}} and {{HMS|Exeter|68|6}}. In addition to earning the battle honour 'River Plate', HMNZS ''Achilles'' also served at Guadalcanal 1942–1943 and Okinawa in 1945. After returning to the Royal Navy, the ship was sold to the [[Indian Navy]] in 1948, but when she was scrapped parts of the ship were saved and preserved in New Zealand.

'''Abraham Lincoln''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɪ|ŋ|k|ən}} {{Respell|LINK|ən}}; February 12, 1809&nbsp;– April 15, 1865) was the 16th [[president of the United States]], serving from 1861 until [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|his assassination]] in 1865. He led the United States through the [[American Civil War]], defeating the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], playing a major role in the [[End of slavery in the United States|abolition of slavery]], expanding the power of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], and modernizing the [[U.S. economy]].

Lincoln was born into [[poverty]] in a [[log cabin]] in [[Kentucky]], and was raised on the [[American frontier|frontier]]. He was self-educated and became a lawyer, [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] leader, [[Illinois]] state [[Illinois House of Representatives|legislator]], and [[U.S. representative]]. Angered by the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]], which opened the territories to slavery, he became a leader of the new [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He reached a national audience in the [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|1858 Senate campaign debates]] against [[Stephen A. Douglas]]. Lincoln ran for [[1860 United States presidential election|president in 1860]], sweeping the [[Northern United States|North]] to gain victory. Pro-slavery elements in the [[Southern United States|South]] viewed his election as a threat to slavery, and Southern states began [[Secession in the United States|seceding from the nation]]. They formed the Confederate States of America, which began seizing federal military bases in the South. A little over one month after Lincoln assumed the presidency, Confederate forces [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attacked Fort Sumter]], a U.S. fort in [[South Carolina]]. Following the bombardment, Lincoln mobilized forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the union.

Lincoln, a [[Moderate Republicans (Reconstruction era)|moderate Republican]], had to navigate a contentious array of factions with friends and opponents from both the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and Republican parties. His allies, the [[War Democrat]]s and the [[Radical Republicans]], demanded harsh treatment of the Southern Confederates. He managed the factions by exploiting their mutual enmity, carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people. Anti-war Democrats (called "[[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]]") despised Lincoln, and some irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements went so far as to plot his assassination. His [[Gettysburg Address]] became one of the most famous speeches in American history. Lincoln closely supervised the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals, and implemented a [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] of the South's trade. He suspended ''[[habeas corpus]]'' in [[Ex parte Merryman|Maryland]] and [[Habeas Corpus Suspension Act (1863)|elsewhere]], and he averted war with Britain by defusing the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]]. In 1863, he issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which declared the slaves in the states "in rebellion" to be free. It also directed the Army and Navy to "recognize and maintain the freedom of said persons" and to receive them "into the armed service of the United States." Lincoln pressured [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]] to outlaw slavery, and he promoted the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]], which abolished slavery, except as punishment for a crime. Lincoln managed his own successful [[1864 United States presidential election|re-election campaign]]. He sought to heal the war-torn nation through reconciliation. On April 14, 1865, just five days after the [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Confederate surrender at Appomattox]], he was attending a play at [[Ford's Theatre]] in Washington, D.C., with his wife, [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary]], when he was fatally shot by Confederate sympathizer [[John Wilkes Booth]].

Lincoln is remembered as a [[martyr]] and a national hero for his wartime leadership and for his efforts to preserve the Union and abolish slavery.

==Family and childhood==
===Early life===
{{Main|Early life and career of Abraham Lincoln}}
Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, the second child of [[Thomas Lincoln]] and [[Nancy Lincoln|Nancy Hanks Lincoln]], in a log cabin on [[Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park|Sinking Spring Farm]] near [[Hodgenville, Kentucky]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=20–22}} He was a descendant of [[Samuel Lincoln]], an Englishman who migrated from [[Hingham, Norfolk]], to its namesake, [[Hingham, Massachusetts]], in 1638. The family through subsequent generations migrated west, passing through [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Virginia]].{{sfn|Warren|2017|pp=3–4}} Lincoln was also a descendant of the [[Harrison family of Virginia]]; his paternal grandfather and namesake, [[Abraham Lincoln (captain)|Captain Abraham Lincoln]] and wife Bathsheba (née Herring) moved the family from Virginia to [[Jefferson County, Kentucky]].{{efn|The identity of Lincoln's grandmother Bathsheba Herring, though without certainty, is the consensus of multiple Lincoln biographers. She was the daughter of Alexander and Abigail Herring (née Harrison).{{sfn|Harrison|1935|p=276}}}} The captain was killed in an [[Northwest Indian War|Indian raid]] in 1786.{{sfn|Warren|2017|p=4}} His children, including eight-year-old Thomas, Abraham's father, witnessed the attack.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=21}}{{efn|Thomas, born January 1778, would have been 8 at the attack, May 1786. Older sources use six.{{sfn|Wilson|Davis|Wilson|Herndon|1998|pp=35–36}}}} Thomas then worked at odd jobs in Kentucky and [[Tennessee]] before the family settled in [[Hardin County, Kentucky]], in the early 1800s.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=21}}

Lincoln's mother [[Nancy Lincoln]] is widely assumed to be the daughter of Lucy Hanks.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|p=79}} Thomas and Nancy married on June 12, 1806, in Washington County, and moved to [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky]].{{sfn|Warren|2017|p=9}} They had three children: [[Sarah Lincoln Grigsby|Sarah]], Abraham, and Thomas, who died as an infant.{{sfn|Warren|2017|pp=9–10}}

Thomas Lincoln bought multiple farms in Kentucky, but could not get clear [[Recording (real estate)|property titles]] to any, losing hundreds of acres of land in property disputes.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=22–24}} In 1816, the family moved to [[Indiana]], where the land surveys and titles were more reliable.{{sfn|Warren|2017|p=13}} They settled in an "unbroken forest"{{sfn|Warren|2017|p=26}} in [[Little Pigeon Creek Community]], Hurricane Township, [[History of Perry County, Indiana|Perry County, Indiana]].{{sfn|Warren|2017|pp=16, 43}} When the Lincolns moved to Indiana it had just been [[Admission to the Union|admitted to the Union]] as a [[Slave states and free states|"free" (non-slaveholding)]] state,<ref>[[Michael Burlingame|Burlingame, Michael]], [https://www.knox.edu/documents/LincolnStudies/BurlingameVol1Chap2.pdf ''Abraham Lincoln: A Life'', vol. 1, p. 22]</ref> except that, though "no new enslaved people were allowed, ... currently enslaved individuals remained so".<ref>[https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/underground-railroad-indiana/ "The Underground Railroad in Indiana", ''National Geographic'']</ref>{{efn|Later, this land became part of a separate county in 1818.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|pp=3, 5, 16}}}} In 1860, Lincoln noted that the family's move to Indiana was "partly on account of slavery", but mainly due to land title difficulties.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=23–24}}<ref>{{Cite book | url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/lincoln4|title=Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln. Volume 4.|first=Abraham|last=Lincoln|date=March 8, 2001|pages=61–62}}</ref>
In Kentucky and Indiana, Thomas worked as a farmer, cabinetmaker, and carpenter.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|pp=34, 156}} At various times he owned farms, livestock, and town lots, paid taxes, sat on juries, appraised estates, and served on county patrols. Thomas and Nancy were members of a [[Separate Baptists|Separate Baptist Church]], which "condemned profanity, intoxication, gossip, horse racing, and dancing." Most of its members opposed slavery.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=24}}

Overcoming financial challenges, Thomas in 1827 obtained [[clear title]] to {{convert|80|acre|ha}} in Indiana, an area that became known as [[Little Pigeon Creek Community]].{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|pp=24, 104}}

===Mother's death===
On October 5, 1818, Nancy Lincoln died from [[milk sickness]], leaving 11-year-old Sarah in charge of a household including her father, nine-year-old Abraham, and Nancy's 19-year-old orphan cousin, Dennis Hanks.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|pp=22–23, 77}} Ten years later, on January 20, 1828, Sarah died while giving birth to a stillborn son, devastating Lincoln.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=34, 116}}

On December 2, 1819, Thomas married [[Sarah Bush Lincoln|Sarah Bush Johnston]], a widow from Elizabethtown, Kentucky, with three children of her own.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|pp=23, 83}} Abraham became close to his stepmother and called her "Mother".{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=26–27}} Dennis Hanks said he was lazy, for all his "reading—scribbling—writing—ciphering—writing poetry".<ref>[[Sidney Blumenthal|Blumenthal, Sidney]], ''A Self-Made Man: The Political Life of Abraham Lincoln, 1809-1849''. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2016, p. 29.</ref> His stepmother acknowledged he did not enjoy "physical labor" but loved to read.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|p=66}}{{sfn|White|2009|p=30}}

===Education and move to Illinois===
Lincoln was largely self-educated.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|pp=10, 33}} His formal schooling was from [[itinerant teacher]]s. It included two short stints in Kentucky, where he learned to read, but probably not to write. In Indiana at age seven,{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=23}} due to  farm chores, he attended school only sporadically, for a total of fewer than 12 months in aggregate by age 15.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p= 29}} Nonetheless, he remained an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning.{{sfn|Madison|2014|p=110}} Family, neighbors, and schoolmates recalled that his readings included the [[King James Version|King James Bible]], [[Aesop's Fables]], [[John Bunyan]]'s ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'', [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', and ''[[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin]]''.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=29–31, 38–43}} Despite being self-educated, Lincoln was the recipient of [[honorary degree]]s later in life, including an honorary [[Doctor of Law]]s from [[Columbia University]] in June 1861.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Columbia University Libraries Online Exhibitions {{!}} Jewels in Her Crown: Treasures of Columbia University Libraries Special Collections |url=https://exhibitions.library.columbia.edu/exhibits/show/jewels/themes/new_york/45 |access-date=August 7, 2023 |website=exhibitions.library.columbia.edu}}</ref>

When Lincoln was a teen, his "father grew more and more to depend on him for the 'farming, grubbing, hoeing, making fences' necessary to keep the family afloat. He also regularly hired his son out to work ... and by law, he was entitled to everything the boy earned until he came of age".{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=32}} Lincoln was tall, strong, and athletic, and became adept at using an ax.{{sfn|Warren|2017|pp=134–135}} He was an active wrestler during his youth and trained in the rough [[Catch wrestling|catch-as-catch-can]] style (also known as catch wrestling). He became county wrestling champion at the age of 21.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dellinger |first1=Bob |title=Wrestling in the USA |url=https://nwhof.org/stillwater/resources-library/history/wrestling-in-the-usa/ |website=National Wrestling Hall of Fame |access-date=April 9, 2021}}</ref> He gained a reputation for his strength and audacity after winning a wrestling match with the renowned leader of ruffians known as the Clary's Grove boys.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=40-41}}

In March 1830, fearing another milk sickness outbreak, several members of the extended Lincoln family, including Abraham, moved west to Illinois, a free state, and settled in [[Macon County, Illinois|Macon County]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=36}}{{efn|Historians disagree on who initiated the move; Thomas Lincoln had no obvious reason to do so. One possibility is that other members of the family, including Dennis Hanks, may not have matched Thomas's stability and steady income.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|pp=38–40}}}} Abraham then became increasingly distant from Thomas, in part, due to his father's lack of interest in education.{{sfn|Bartelt|2008|p=71}} In 1831, as Thomas and other family members prepared to move to a [[Lincoln Log Cabin State Historic Site|new homestead]] in [[Coles County, Illinois]], Abraham struck out on his own.{{sfn|Oates|1974|pp=15–17}} He made his home in [[Lincoln's New Salem|New Salem, Illinois]], for six years.{{sfn|Thomas|2008|pp=23–53}} Lincoln and some friends took goods, including live hogs, by [[flatboat]] to [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], where he first witnessed slavery.{{sfnm|Sandburg|1926|1p=202|Donald|1996|2p=38}}

Speculation persists that Lincoln's first romantic interest was [[Ann Rutledge]], whom he met when he moved to New Salem. However, witness testimony, given decades afterward, showed a lack of any specific recollection of a romance between the two.<ref>{{Cite magazine | last=Gannett | first=Lewis | date=Winter 2005 | title='Overwhelming Evidence' of a Lincoln-Ann Rutledge Romance?: Reexamining Rutledge Family Reminiscences | url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0026.104/--overwhelming-evidence-of-a-lincoln-ann-rutledge-romance?rgn=main;view=fulltext | magazine=Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association | location=Springfield, IL | publisher=The Abraham Lincoln Association | pages=28–41 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403014805/https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0026.104/--overwhelming-evidence-of-a-lincoln-ann-rutledge-romance?rgn=main;view=fulltext | archive-date=April 3, 2017}}</ref> Rutledge died on August 25, 1835, most likely of [[typhoid fever]]; Lincoln took the death very hard, saying that he could not bear the idea of rain falling on Ann's grave. Lincoln sank into a serious episode of depression, and this gave rise to speculation that he had been in love with her.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=55–58}}<ref name="Atlanticoct2005" /><ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.npr.org/2005/10/26/4976127/exploring-abraham-lincolns-melancholy | title=Exploring Abraham Lincoln's 'Melancholy' | author=Siegel, Robert | date=October 26, 2005 | access-date=February 17, 2023}}</ref>

In the early 1830s, he met [[Mary Owens (Abraham Lincoln fiancée)|Mary Owens]] from Kentucky.{{sfn|Thomas|2008|pp=56–57, 69–70}} Late in 1836, Lincoln agreed to a match with Owens if she returned to New Salem. Owens arrived that November and he courted her; however, they both had second thoughts. On August 16, 1837, he wrote Owens a letter saying he would not blame her if she ended the relationship, and she never replied.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=67}}

In 1839, Lincoln met [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]] in [[Springfield, Illinois]], and the following year they became engaged.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=80–86}} She was the daughter of [[Robert Smith Todd]], a wealthy lawyer and businessman in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].{{sfn|Lamb|Swain|2008|p=3}} Their wedding, which was set for January 1, 1841, was canceled because Lincoln did not appear, but they reconciled and married on November 4, 1842, in the Springfield home of Mary's sister.{{sfn|Sandburg|1926|pp=260,290–291}} While anxiously preparing for the nuptials, he was asked where he was going and replied, "To hell, I suppose".{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=93}} In 1844, the couple bought [[Lincoln Home National Historic Site|a house]] in Springfield near his law office. Mary kept house with the help of a hired servant and a relative.{{sfn|Baker|1989|p=142}}

Lincoln was an affectionate husband and father of four sons, though his work regularly kept him away from home. The eldest, [[Robert Todd Lincoln]], was born in 1843, and was the only child to live to maturity. [[Edward Baker Lincoln]] (Eddie), born in 1846, died February 1, 1850, probably of tuberculosis. Lincoln's third son, [[William Wallace Lincoln|"Willie" Lincoln]], was born on December 21, 1850, and died of a fever at the [[White House]] on February 20, 1862. The youngest, [[Tad Lincoln|Thomas "Tad" Lincoln]], was born on April 4, 1853, and survived his father, but died of heart failure at age 18 on July 16, 1871.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=179–181, 476}}{{efn|The Lincolns' last descendant, great-grandson [[Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith]], died in 1985.<ref>{{cite book|author=Emerson, Jason |title=Giant in the Shadows: The Life of Robert T.

Lincoln "was remarkably fond of children"{{sfn|White|2009|p=126}} and the Lincolns were not considered to be strict with their own.{{sfn|Baker|1989|p=120}} In fact, Lincoln's law partner [[William H. Herndon]] would grow irritated when Lincoln brought his children to the law office. Their father, it seemed, was often too absorbed in his work to notice his children's behavior. Herndon recounted, "I have felt many and many a time that I wanted to wring their little necks, and yet out of respect for Lincoln I kept my mouth shut. Lincoln did not note what his children were doing or had done."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hertz |first1=Emanuel |title=The Hidden Lincoln |date=1938 |publisher=The Viking Press |page=105}}</ref>

The deaths of their sons Eddie and Willie had profound effects on both parents. Lincoln suffered from "[[history of depression|melancholy]]", a condition now thought to be [[major depressive disorder|clinical depression]].<ref name="Atlanticoct2005">{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200510/lincolns-clinical-depression |title=Lincoln's Great Depression |first=Joshua Wolf |last=Shenk |date=October 2005 |work=The Atlantic |publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009044732/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/10/lincoln-apos-s-great-depression/4247/ |archive-date=October 9, 2011 |url-status=live |access-date=October 8, 2009}}</ref> Later in life, Mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons, and in 1875 Robert committed her to an asylum.{{sfn|Steers|2010|p=341}}

== Early career and militia service ==
{{Further|Early life and career of Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln in the Black Hawk War}}
During 1831 and 1832, Lincoln worked at a general store in [[Lincoln's New Salem|New Salem, Illinois]]. In 1832, he declared his candidacy for the [[Illinois House of Representatives]], but interrupted his campaign to serve as a captain in the [[Illinois Militia]] during the [[Black Hawk War]].{{sfn|Winkle|2001|pp=86–95}} When Lincoln returned home from the [[Black Hawk War]], he planned to become a blacksmith, but instead formed a partnership with 21-year-old William Berry, with whom he purchased a New Salem general store on credit. Because a license was required to sell customers beverages, Berry obtained bartending licenses for $7 each for Lincoln and himself, and in 1833 the [[Lincoln-Berry General Store]] became a tavern as well.<ref>''And There Was Light'', by Jon Meacham, 2022, Random House, page 38.</ref>

As licensed bartenders, Lincoln and Berry were able to sell spirits, including liquor, for 12 cents a pint. They offered a wide range of alcoholic beverages as well as food, including takeout dinners. But Berry became an alcoholic, was often too drunk to work, and Lincoln ended up running the store by himself.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Blazeski |first=Goran |date=October 15, 2016 |title=Abraham Lincoln was the only President who was also a licensed bartender |url=https://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/10/15/abraham-lincoln-was-the-only-president-who-was-also-a-licensed-bartender/?chrome=1&A1c=1 |access-date=March 4, 2022 |website=The Vintage News}}</ref> Although the economy was booming, the business struggled and went into debt, causing Lincoln to sell his share.<ref>''And There Was Light'', by Jon Meacham, 2022, Random House, page 38.</ref>

In his first campaign speech after returning from his military service, Lincoln observed a supporter in the crowd under attack, grabbed the assailant by his "neck and the seat of his trousers", and tossed him.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=36}} In the campaign, Lincoln advocated for navigational improvements on the [[Sangamon River]]. He could draw crowds as a [[raconteur]], but lacked the requisite formal education, powerful friends, and money, and lost the election.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hN7QQgAACAAJ}}|title=Life and Works of Abraham Lincoln Volume 3 |chapter=The Improvement of Sangamon River|last=Lincoln|first=Abraham|editor-first=Marion Mills |editor-last=Miller |year=1832|publisher=Wildside Press|isbn=978-1-4344-2497-6}} [[s:Life and Works of Abraham Lincoln/Volume 3/The Improvement of Sangamon River|WP article]]</ref> Lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates (the top four were elected), though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the New Salem precinct.{{sfn|Winkle|2001|pp=114–116}}

Hardin]], though he prevailed with the party in limiting Hardin to one term. Lincoln not only pulled off his strategy of gaining the nomination in 1846, but also won the election.

=== Political views ===
On foreign and military policy, Lincoln spoke against the [[Mexican–American War]], which he imputed President [[James K. Polk]]'s desire for "military glory — that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood".{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2006|pp=181–183}} He supported the [[Wilmot Proviso]], a failed proposal to ban slavery in any U.S. territory won from Mexico.{{sfn|Holzer|2004|p=63}}

Lincoln emphasized his opposition to Polk by drafting and introducing his [[Spot Resolutions]]. The war had begun with a killing of American soldiers by Mexican cavalry patrol in disputed territory, and Polk insisted that Mexican soldiers had "invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our own soil".{{sfn|Oates|1974|pp=79–80}} Lincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on American soil.{{sfn|Graebner|1959|pp=199–202}} The resolution was ignored in both Congress and the national papers, and it cost Lincoln political support in his district.

Lincoln appeared before the Illinois Supreme Court in 175 cases; he was sole counsel in 51 cases, of which 31 were decided in his favor.{{sfn|Richards|2015|p=440}} From 1853 to 1860, one of his largest clients was the [[Illinois Central Railroad]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=155–156, 196–197}} His legal reputation gave rise to the nickname "Honest Abe".<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=5GJ6Un1JA_8C}}|title=The Wisdom of Abraham Lincoln|last=Library|first=Philosophical|date=November 9, 2010|publisher=Open Road Media|isbn=978-1-4532-0281-4}}</ref>

In an 1858 criminal trial, Lincoln represented William "Duff" Armstrong, who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=150–151}} The case is famous for Lincoln's use of a fact established by [[judicial notice]] to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness. After an opposing witness testified to seeing the crime in the moonlight, Lincoln produced a ''[[Farmers' Almanac]]'' showing the Moon was at a low angle, drastically reducing visibility. Armstrong was acquitted.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=150–151}}

In an 1859 murder case, leading up to his presidential campaign, Lincoln elevated his profile with his defense of Simeon Quinn "Peachy" Harrison, who was a third cousin;{{efn|Lincoln was a descendant of the Harrisons through his grandmother, Bathsheba Herring.{{sfn|Harrison|1935|pp=280–286, 350–351}}}} Harrison was also the grandson of Lincoln's political opponent, [[Peter Cartwright (revivalist)|Rev.

===Emergence as Republican leader===
{{Further|Slave states and free states|Abraham Lincoln and slavery}}
[[File:Abraham Lincoln by Byers, 1858 - crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Lincoln in May 1858, the year of [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|his debates]] with [[Stephen A. Douglas|Stephen Douglas]] over slavery]]

The debate over the status of slavery in the territories failed to alleviate tensions between the slave-holding South and the free North, with the failure of the [[Compromise of 1850]], a legislative package designed to address the issue.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=175–176}} In his 1852 eulogy for Clay, Lincoln highlighted the latter's support for gradual emancipation and opposition to "both extremes" on the slavery issue.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=182–185}} As the slavery debate in the [[Nebraska Territory|Nebraska]] and [[Kansas Territory|Kansas]] territories became particularly acrimonious, Illinois Senator Stephen A. Douglas proposed [[Popular sovereignty in the United States#Emergence of the term "popular sovereignty" and its pejorative connotation|popular sovereignty]] as a compromise; the measure would allow the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery. The legislation alarmed many Northerners, who sought to prevent the spread of slavery that could result, but Douglas's [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] narrowly passed Congress in May 1854.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=188–190}}

Lincoln did not comment on the act until months later in his "[[Abraham Lincoln's Peoria speech|Peoria Speech]]" of October 1854. Lincoln then declared his opposition to slavery, which he repeated en route to the presidency.{{sfn|Thomas|2008|pp=148–152}} He said the Kansas Act had a "''declared'' indifference, but as I must think, a covert ''real'' zeal for the spread of slavery. I cannot but hate it. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world...."{{sfn|Graebner|1959|p=255}} Lincoln's attacks on the Kansas–Nebraska Act marked his return to political life.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=203–205}}

Nationally, the Whigs were irreparably split by the Kansas–Nebraska Act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue. Reflecting on the demise of his party, Lincoln wrote in 1855, "I think I am a Whig, but others say there are no Whigs, and that I am an abolitionist. ... I do no more than oppose the ''extension'' of slavery."{{sfn|White|2009|pp=215–216}} The new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] was formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery, drawing from the antislavery wing of the Whig Party and combining [[Free Soil Party|Free Soil]], [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty]], and antislavery [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] members,{{sfn|McGovern|2009|pp=38–39}} Lincoln resisted early Republican entreaties, fearing that the new party would become a platform for extreme abolitionists.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=203–204}} Lincoln held out hope for rejuvenating the Whigs, though he lamented his party's growing closeness with the nativist [[Know Nothing]] movement.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=191–194}}

In 1854, Lincoln was elected to the Illinois legislature, but before the term began the following January he declined to take his seat so that he would be eligible to be a candidate in the upcoming U.S. Senate election.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Notice that Abraham Lincoln declines to serve in the General Assembly (1854) |url=https://www.ilsos.gov/departments/archives/online_exhibits/100_documents/1854-lincoln-declines-ga.html |website=Office of the Illinois Secretary of State}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Oates |first=Stephen |title=With Malice Toward None: A Biography of Abraham Lincoln |year=1977 |pages=118–120}}</ref> The year's elections showed the strong opposition to the Kansas–Nebraska Act, and in the aftermath Lincoln sought election to the U.S. Senate.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=203–205}} At that time, senators were elected by state legislatures.{{sfn|Oates|1974|p=119}} After leading in the first six rounds of voting, he was unable to obtain a majority. Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for [[Lyman Trumbull]]. Trumbull was an antislavery Democrat and had received few votes in the earlier ballots; his supporters, also antislavery Democrats, had vowed not to support any Whig. Lincoln's decision to withdraw enabled his Whig supporters and Trumbull's antislavery Democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream Democratic candidate, [[Joel Aldrich Matteson]].{{sfn|White|2009|pp=205–208}}

==== 1856 campaign ====
[[Bleeding Kansas|Violent political confrontations in Kansas]] continued, and opposition to the Kansas–Nebraska Act remained strong throughout the North. As the [[1856 United States elections|1856 elections]] approached, Lincoln joined the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and attended the [[Bloomington Convention]], where the [[Illinois Republican Party]] was established . The convention platform endorsed Congress's right to regulate slavery in the territories and backed the admission of Kansas as a free state. Lincoln gave the [[Lincoln's Lost Speech|final speech]] of the convention supporting the party platform and called for the preservation of the Union.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=216–221}} At the June [[1856 Republican National Convention]], though Lincoln received support to run as vice president, [[John C. Frémont]] and [[William Dayton]] were on the ticket, which Lincoln supported throughout Illinois. The Democrats nominated former Secretary of State [[James Buchanan]] and the Know-Nothings nominated former Whig President [[Millard Fillmore]].{{sfn|White|2009|pp=224–228}} Buchanan prevailed, while Republican [[William Henry Bissell]] won election as Governor of Illinois, and Lincoln became a leading Republican in Illinois.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=229–230}}{{efn|[[Eric Foner]] contrasts the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast, who saw slavery as a sin, with the conservative Republicans, who thought it was bad because it hurt [[white people]] and blocked progress. Foner argues that Lincoln was in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the [[republicanism in the United States|republicanism principles]] of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].{{sfn|Foner|2010|pp=84–88}}}}

==== ''Dred Scott v. Sandford'' ====
[[Dred Scott]] was a slave whose master took him from a slave state to a territory that was free as a result of the [[Missouri Compromise]]. After Scott was returned to the slave state, he petitioned a federal court for his freedom. His petition was denied in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' (1857).{{Efn|Although the name of the Supreme Court case is ''Dred Scott v. Sandford'', the respondent's [[surname]] was actually "Sanford". A [[court clerk|clerk]] misspelled the name, and the court never corrected the error.<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Vishneski|first=John| year=1988| title=What the Court Decided in Dred Scott v.

Taney]] wrote that black people were not citizens and derived no rights from the Constitution, and that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional for infringing upon slave owners' "property" rights. While many Democrats hoped that ''Dred Scott'' would end the dispute over slavery in the territories, the decision sparked further outrage in the North.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=236–238}} Lincoln denounced it as the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the [[Slave Power]].{{sfn|Zarefsky|1993|pp=69–110}} He argued the decision was at variance with the Declaration of Independence; he said that while the founding fathers did not believe all men equal in every respect, they believed all men were equal "in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness".{{sfn|Jaffa|2000|pp=299–300}}

===Lincoln–Douglas debates and Cooper Union speech===
{{Further|Lincoln–Douglas debates|Cooper Union speech}}

In 1858, Douglas was up for re-election in the U.S. Senate, and Lincoln hoped to defeat him. Many in the party felt that a former Whig should be nominated in 1858, and Lincoln's 1856 campaigning and support of Trumbull had earned him a favor.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=247–248}} Some eastern Republicans supported Douglas for his opposition to the [[Lecompton Constitution]] and admission of Kansas as a [[slave state]].{{sfn|Oates|1974|pp=138–139}} Many Illinois Republicans resented this eastern interference. For the first time, Illinois Republicans held a convention to agree upon a Senate candidate, and Lincoln won the nomination with little opposition.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=247–250}}
[[File:Lincoln O-17 by Brady, 1860.png|thumb|left|''Abraham Lincoln'', a portrait by [[Mathew Brady]] taken February 27, 1860, the day of Lincoln's [[Cooper Union speech]] in New York City]]

Lincoln accepted the nomination with great enthusiasm and zeal. After his nomination he delivered his [[Lincoln's House Divided Speech|House Divided Speech]], with the biblical reference [[Mark 3#A house divided|Mark 3:25]], "A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other."{{sfn|White|2009|p=251}} The speech created a stark image of the danger of disunion.{{sfn|Harris|2007|p=98}} The stage was then set for the election of the Illinois legislature which would, in turn, select Lincoln or Douglas.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=209}} When informed of Lincoln's nomination, Douglas stated, "[Lincoln] is the strong man of the party&nbsp;... and if I beat him, my victory will be hardly won."{{sfn|White|2009|pp=257–258}}

The Senate campaign featured seven [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|debates]] between Lincoln and Douglas. These were the most famous political debates in American history; they had an atmosphere akin to a prizefight and drew crowds in the thousands.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=214–218}} The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. Lincoln warned that the [[Slave Power]] was threatening the values of republicanism, and he accused Douglas of distorting the Founding Fathers' premise that [[all men are created equal]]. In his [[Freeport Doctrine]], Douglas argued that, despite the [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|Dred Scott]] decision, which he claimed to support,{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=202, 219, 232}} local settlers, under the doctrine of [[Popular sovereignty in the United States|popular sovereignty]], should be free to choose whether to allow slavery within their territory, and he accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=214–224}} Lincoln's argument assumed a moral tone, as he claimed that Douglas represented a conspiracy to promote slavery. Douglas's argument was more legal in nature, claiming that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court as exercised in the ''Dred Scott'' decision.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=223}}

Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas. However, Lincoln's articulation of the issues had given him a national political presence.{{sfn|Carwardine|2003|pp=89–90}} In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the ''Illinois Staats-Anzeiger'', a German-language newspaper that was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130,000 German Americans voted for Democrats, but the German-language paper mobilized Republican support.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=242, 412}} In the aftermath of the 1858 election, newspapers frequently mentioned Lincoln as a potential Republican presidential candidate, rivaled by [[William H. Seward]], [[Salmon P. Chase]], [[Edward Bates]], and [[Simon Cameron]]. While Lincoln was popular in the Midwest, he lacked support in the Northeast and was unsure whether to seek the office.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=291–293}} In January 1860, Lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the presidential nomination if offered and, in the following months, several local papers endorsed his candidacy.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=307–308}}

Over the coming months Lincoln was tireless, making nearly fifty speeches along the campaign trail. By the quality and simplicity of his rhetoric, he quickly became the champion of the Republican party. However, despite his overwhelming support in the [[Midwestern United States]], he was less appreciated in the east. [[Horace Greeley]], editor of the New York Tribune, at that time wrote up an unflattering account of Lincoln's compromising position on slavery and his reluctance to challenge the court's ''Dred Scott'' ruling, which was promptly used against him by his political rivals.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=200}}{{sfn|Morse|1893|p=112}}

On February 27, 1860, powerful New York Republicans invited Lincoln to give a [[Cooper Union speech|speech at Cooper Union]], in which he argued that the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery. He insisted that morality required opposition to slavery and rejected any "groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong".{{sfn|Jaffa|2000|p=473}} Many in the audience thought he appeared awkward and even ugly.{{sfn|Holzer|2004|pp=108–111}} But Lincoln demonstrated intellectual leadership, which brought him into contention. Journalist [[Noah Brooks]] reported, "No man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience".{{sfnm|Carwardine|2003|1p=97|Holzer|2004|2p=157}}

Historian [[David Herbert Donald]] described the speech as "a superb political move for an unannounced presidential aspirant. Appearing in Seward's home state, sponsored by a group largely loyal to Chase, Lincoln shrewdly made no reference to either of these Republican rivals for the nomination."{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=240}} In response to an inquiry about his ambitions, Lincoln said, "The taste ''is'' in my mouth a little".{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=241}}

On May 18 at the [[1860 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] in Chicago, Lincoln won the nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as Seward and Chase. A former Democrat, [[Hannibal Hamlin]] of Maine, was nominated for vice president to [[Ticket balance|balance the ticket]]. Lincoln's success depended on his campaign team, his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for internal improvements and the tariff.{{sfn|Luthin|1944|pp=609–629}} Pennsylvania put him over the top, led by the state's iron interests who were reassured by his tariff support.{{sfn|Hofstadter|1938|pp=50–55}} Lincoln's managers had focused on this delegation while honoring Lincoln's dictate to "Make no contracts that will bind me".{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=247–250}}

As the Slave Power tightened its grip on the national government, most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party. Throughout the 1850s, Lincoln had doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession.{{sfn|Boritt|Pinsker|2002|pp=10, 13, 18}} When Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats, delegates from eleven slave states walked out of the [[1860 Democratic National Convention|Democratic convention]]; they opposed Douglas's position on popular sovereignty, and selected incumbent Vice President [[John C. Breckinridge]] as their candidate.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=253}} A group of former Whigs and Know Nothings formed the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] and nominated [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] of Tennessee. Lincoln and Douglas competed for votes in the North, while Bell and Breckinridge primarily found support in the South.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=247–248}}

Before the Republican convention, the Lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide youth organization, the [[Wide Awakes]], which it used to generate popular support throughout the country to spearhead voter registration drives, thinking that new voters and young voters tended to embrace new parties.<ref>{{cite book|title=Lincoln for President: An Unlikely Candidate, An Audacious Strategy, and the Victory No One Saw Coming|last=Chadwick|first=Bruce|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=2PQqZzyw4uAC|page=l49}}|pages=147–149|publisher=Sourcebooks|location=Naperville, Illinois|date=2009|access-date=April 1, 2017|isbn=978-1-4022-4756-9}}</ref> People of the Northern states knew the Southern states would vote against Lincoln and rallied supporters for Lincoln.<ref>Murrin, John (2006).

As Douglas and the other candidates campaigned, Lincoln gave no speeches, relying on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party. The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials. Republican speakers focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. The goal was to demonstrate the power of "free labor", which allowed a common farm boy to work his way to the top by his own efforts.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=254–256}} The Republican Party's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a ''Chicago Tribune'' writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln's life and sold 100,000–200,000 copies.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=254}} Though he did not give public appearances, many sought to visit him and write him. In the runup to the election, he took an office in the Illinois state capitol to deal with the influx of attention. He also hired [[John George Nicolay]] as his personal secretary, who would remain in that role during the presidency.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=251–252|p=}}

On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected the 16th president. He was the first Republican president and his victory was entirely due to his support in the North and West. No ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states, and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states, an omen of the impending Civil War.{{sfn|Mansch|2005|p=61}}{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=256}} Lincoln received 1,866,452 votes, or 39.8% of the total in a four-way race, carrying the free Northern states, as well as California and Oregon.{{sfn|White|2009|p=350}} His victory in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] was decisive: Lincoln had 180 votes to 123 for his opponents.{{sfn|Nevins|1947|p=4:312}}

The South was outraged by Lincoln's election, and in response secessionists implemented plans to leave the Union before he took office in March 1861.{{sfn|Edgar|1998|p=350}} On December 20, 1860, South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by February 1, 1861, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed.{{sfnm|Donald|1996|1p=267|Potter|1977|p2=498}} Six of these states declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the [[Confederate States of America]], and adopted a constitution.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=267}} The upper South and border states (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) initially rejected the secessionist appeal.{{sfn|White|2009|p=362}} President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy, declaring secession illegal.{{sfn|Potter|1977|pp=520, 569–570}} The Confederacy selected [[Jefferson Davis]] as its provisional president on February 9, 1861.{{sfn|White|2009|p=369}}

Attempts at compromise followed but Lincoln and the Republicans rejected the proposed [[Crittenden Compromise]] as contrary to the Party's platform of free-soil in the [[Territories of the United States|territories]].{{sfn|White|2009|pp=360–361}} Lincoln said, "I will suffer death before I consent&nbsp;... to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right".{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=268}}

Lincoln supported the [[Corwin Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]], which passed Congress and was awaiting ratification by the states when Lincoln took office. That doomed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed.{{sfnm|Vorenberg|2001|1p=22|Vile|2003|2pp=280–281}} On March 4, 1861, in his [[Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address|first inaugural address]], Lincoln said that, because he holds "such a provision to now be implied constitutional law, I have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/lincoln1.asp|title=Inaugural Addresses of the Presidents of the United States : from George Washington 1789 to George Bush 1989|website=avalon.law.yale.edu}}</ref> A few weeks before the war, Lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them Congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the Constitution.{{sfn|Lupton|2006|p=34}}

On February 11, 1861, Lincoln gave a particularly emotional [[Abraham Lincoln's farewell address|farewell address]] upon leaving Springfield; he would never again return to Springfield alive.<ref>{{cite web|title=Broadside, 'President Lincoln's Farewell Address to His Old Neighbors, Springfield, February 12, 1861' – The Henry Ford|url=https://www.thehenryford.org/collections-and-research/digital-collections/artifact/236607/|access-date=December 5, 2020|website=www.thehenryford.org|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Lincoln's Farewell Address – Illinois History & Lincoln Collections|date=January 27, 2018 |url=https://publish.illinois.edu/ihlc-blog/2018/01/27/lincolns-farewell-address/|access-date=December 5, 2020|language=en-US}}</ref> Lincoln traveled east on a special train. Due to secessionist plots, unprecedented attention to security was given to him and his train.

He traveled in disguise, wearing a soft felt hat instead of his customary stovepipe hat and draping an overcoat over his shoulders while hunching slightly to conceal his height. His friend Congressman [[Elihu B. Washburne]] recognized him on the platform upon arrival and loudly called out to him.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/lincoln-arrives-in-washington | title=Abraham Lincoln arrives in Washington, D.C. &#124; February 23, 1861 }}</ref> On February 23, 1861, he arrived in Washington, D.C., which was placed under substantial military guard.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=277–279}} Lincoln directed [[Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address|his inaugural address]] to the South, proclaiming once again that he had no inclination to abolish slavery in the Southern states:
{{Blockquote|Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States, that by the accession of a Republican Administration, their property, and their peace, and personal security, are to be endangered. There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed, and been open to their inspection. It is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you. I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that "I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so."|[[Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address|First inaugural address]], 4 March 1861<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/lincoln4|title=Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln. Volume 4.|first=Abraham|last=Lincoln|date=March 8, 2001|page=333}}</ref>{{sfn|Sandburg|2002|p=212}}|source=}} Lincoln cited his plans for banning the expansion of slavery as the key source of conflict between North and South, stating "One section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended. This is the only substantial dispute." The president ended his address with an appeal to the people of the South: "We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies.... The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature."{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=283–284}} The failure of the [[Peace Conference of 1861]] signaled that legislative compromise was impossible. By March 1861, no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. Meanwhile, Lincoln and the Republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=268, 279}} In his [[Lincoln's second inaugural address|second inaugural address]], Lincoln looked back on the situation at the time and said: "Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the Nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came."
